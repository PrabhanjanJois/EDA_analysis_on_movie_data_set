# EDA_analysis_on_movie_data_set
This was my mini/minor project from a private company(https://www.verzeo.in/). 
Exploratory Data Analysis, or EDA, is essentially a type of storytelling for statisticians. EDA is often the first step of the data modelling process. Here I have done it using Python and have attached the following documents.
           The documents attached are as follows:
            1) A pdf file containing only question and answers.
            2) A pdf file of my Jupiter notebook
            3) A ipynb file of my Jupiter notebook
